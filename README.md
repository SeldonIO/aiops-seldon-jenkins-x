# A practical guide to MLOps with Seldon Core and Jenkins X

This tutorial provides an end-to-end tutorial that shows you how to build you MLOps pipeline with Seldon Core and Jenkins X:

* Seldon Core is a machine learning deployment & orchestration engine in Kubernetes
* Jenkins X provides automated CI+CD for Kubernetes with Preview Environments on Pull Requests

## Current limitations

### Prepackaged Model Servers vs Language Wrappers

Ideally we would be able to show in this tutorial two workflows: 1) creating a model server, and 2) deploying multiple applications with that model server. At this point in time, there is only one workflow in this repository, which consists of building and deploying a single Seldon Model using a language wrapper, which means that the docker image is built every time. 

### Quickstart and buildpack

A lot of the logic in this tutorial could simplified by creating a quickstart project and possibly a build pack (although most of the logic can be built as part of a build pack initially).

### Docker builds in cluster required

Currently, the images are built and pushed using a pod with a docker daemon, this is because of the current dependency Seldon has on S2i (Source-to-image) to build the image wrappers.

Furthermore, docker is also required to run the end-to-end tests, which leverage KIND (kubernetes in docker) to spin up a test kubernetes cluster inside of a Kubernetes Pod.

## Intuitive explanation

In this project, we will be building an MLOps workflow to deploy your production machine learning models by buiding a re-usable pre-packaged model server through CI, and then deploying individual models using CD.

[TODO: ARCHITECTURAL DIAGRAM]

## Requirements

* A Kubernetes cluster running v1.13+ (this was run using GKE)
* The [jx CLI](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/) version 2.0.916
* Jenkins-X installed in your cluster (you can set it up with the [jx boot tutorial](https://jenkins-x.io/docs/getting-started/setup/boot/))
* Seldon Core [v0.5.0 installed]() in your cluster

Once you set everything up, we'll be ready to kick off ðŸš€

# Setting up repo

Now we want to start setting up our repo. For this we will create the following structure:

* `jenkins-x.yml` - File specifying the CI / CD steps 
* `Makefile` - Commands to build and test model
* `README.(md|ipynb)` - This file!
* `VERSION` - A file containing the version which is updated upon each release
* `charts/` - Folder containing the deployment configuration information
* `integration/` - Folder containing integration tests using KIND
* `src`
    * `ModelName.py` - Model server wrapper file
    * `test_ModelName.py` - Unit test for model server
    * `requirements-dev.txt` - Requirements for testing
    * `requirements.txt` - Requiremnets for prod


## Let's train a model locally

First we will train a machine learning model, which will help us classify news across multiple categories.

### Install dependencies 

We will need the following dependencies in order to run the Python code:


```python
%%writefile requirements-dev.txt
scikit-learn==0.20.1
pytest==5.1.1
joblib==0.13.2
```

    Overwriting requirements-dev.txt


We can now install the dependencies using the make command:


```python
!make install_dev
```

### Download the ML data

Now that we have all the dependencies we can proceed to download the data.

We will download the news stories dataset, and we'll be attempting to classify across the four classes below.


```python
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups
categories = ['alt.atheism', 'soc.religion.christian',
              'comp.graphics', 'sci.med']

twenty_train = fetch_20newsgroups(
    subset='train', categories=categories, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

twenty_test = fetch_20newsgroups(
    subset='test', categories=categories, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

# Printing the top 3 newstories
print("\n".join(twenty_train.data[0].split("\n")[:3]))
```

### Train a model

Now that we've downloaded the data, we can train the ML model using a simple pipeline with basic text pre-processors and a Multiclass naive bayes classifier


```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfTransformer, CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

text_clf = Pipeline([
    ('vect', CountVectorizer()),
    ('tfidf', TfidfTransformer()),
    ('clf', MultinomialNB()),
])

text_clf.fit(twenty_train.data, twenty_train.target)
```




    Pipeline(memory=None,
             steps=[('vect',
                     CountVectorizer(analyzer='word', binary=False,
                                     decode_error='strict',
                                     dtype=<class 'numpy.int64'>, encoding='utf-8',
                                     input='content', lowercase=True, max_df=1.0,
                                     max_features=None, min_df=1,
                                     ngram_range=(1, 1), preprocessor=None,
                                     stop_words=None, strip_accents=None,
                                     token_pattern='(?u)\\b\\w\\w+\\b',
                                     tokenizer=None, vocabulary=None)),
                    ('tfidf',
                     TfidfTransformer(norm='l2', smooth_idf=True,
                                      sublinear_tf=False, use_idf=True)),
                    ('clf',
                     MultinomialNB(alpha=1.0, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True))],
             verbose=False)



### Test single prediction

Now that we've trained our model we can use it to predict from un-seen data.

We can see below that the model is able to predict the first datapoint in the dataset correctly.


```python
idx = 0
print(f"CONTENT:{twenty_test.data[idx][35:230]}\n\n-----------\n")
print(f"PREDICTED CLASS: {categories[twenty_test.target[idx]]}")
```

    CONTENT:
    Subject: Re: HELP for Kidney Stones ..............
    Organization: The Avant-Garde of the Now, Ltd.
    Lines: 12
    NNTP-Posting-Host: ucsd.edu
    
    As I recall from my bout with kidney stones, there isn't 
    
    -----------
    
    PREDICTED CLASS: comp.graphics


### Print accuracy

We can print the accuracy of the model by running the test data and counting the number of correct classes.


```python
import numpy as np

predicted = text_clf.predict(twenty_test.data)
print(f"Accuracy: {np.mean(predicted == twenty_test.target):.2f}")
```

    Accuracy: 0.83


## Deploy the model

Now we want to be able to deploy the model we just trained. For this we'll follow the standard steps to wrap the model using Seldon.

### Save the trained model

First we have to save the trained model in the `src/` folder, which our wrapper will load


```python
import joblib
joblib.dump(text_clf, "src/model.joblib")
```




    ['src/model.joblib']



### Build wrapper that loads model

Now we can actually write a simple wrapper that basically loads the model and exposes the logic through the `predict` function.


```python
%%writefile src/SklearnServer.py

import joblib, logging

class SklearnServer:
    def __init__(self):
        self._model = joblib.load(f"model.joblib")

    def predict(self, data, feature_names=[], metadata={}):
        logging.info(data)

        prediction = self._model.predict(data)

        logging.info(prediction)

        return prediction
```

    Overwriting src/SklearnServer.py


### Test the wrapper

It's best practice to write a set of unit tests to make sure that our wrapper works as expected.

We'll write a single unit test and then we'll run it using Pytest


```python
%%writefile src/test_SklearnServer.py

from .SklearnServer import SklearnServer
import numpy as np

from unittest import mock

# Libraries to patch:
import joblib

EXPECTED_RESPONSE = np.array([0, 1])

class FakeModel:
    def predict(self, df):
        return EXPECTED_RESPONSE


@mock.patch("joblib.load", return_value=FakeModel())
def test_sklearn_server(*args, **kwargs):
    data = ["text 1", "text 2"]

    s = SklearnServer()
    result = s.predict(data)
    assert all(result == EXPECTED_RESPONSE)

```

    Overwriting src/test_SklearnServer.py



```python
!make test
```

    cat: VERSION: No such file or directory

### Define config files

Now that our wrapper works as expected, we just need to write a set of configuration files, including dependencies and the type of model.


```python
%%writefile src/requirements.txt
scikit-learn==0.20.1
joblib==0.13.2
```

    Overwriting src/requirements.txt



```python
%%writefile src/seldon_model.conf
MODEL_NAME=SklearnServer
API_TYPE=REST
SERVICE_TYPE=MODEL
PERSISTENCE=0
```

    Overwriting src/seldon_model.conf


### Build container with s2i untils

Now we leverage the `s2i` util to convert our wrapped model into a fully fledged REST server that exposes the logic through an API.


```bash
%%bash
SELDON_BASE_WRAPPER="seldonio/seldon-core-s2i-python36:0.12"
s2i build src/. $SELDON_BASE_WRAPPER sklearn-server:0.1 \
    --environment-file src/seldon_model.conf
```

### Deploy model 

Now that we've built our model, we can push it and deploy it to our kubernetes cluster for evaluation


```python
!cat charts/sklearn-model-server/templates/sklearn-seldon-deployment.yaml
```

    apiVersion: machinelearning.seldon.io/v1alpha2
    kind: SeldonDeployment
    metadata:
      name: {{ .Values.model.name }}
    spec:
      name: {{ .Values.model.name }}
      predictors:

              - name: {{ $pkey }}

```python
!helm install charts/sklearn-model-server
```

    seldondeployment.machinelearning.seldon.io/news-classifier-server created


### Test server by sending request

Now that we've deployed our model, we can test it by sending a POST request. 

This can be done using our SeldonCore Python client, or by just sending it through `curl`. Both are shown below:


```python
from seldon_core.seldon_client import SeldonClient
import numpy as np

url = !kubectl get svc ambassador -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}'

sc = SeldonClient(
    gateway="ambassador", 
    gateway_endpoint="localhost:80",
    deployment_name="news-classifier-server",
    payload_type="ndarray",
    namespace="default",
    transport="rest")

response = sc.predict(data=np.array([twenty_test.data[0]]))

response.response.data
```




    ndarray {
      values {
        number_value: 2.0
      }
    }




```bash
%%bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d "{'data': {'names': ['text'], 'ndarray': ['Hello world this is a test']}}" \
    http://localhost/seldon/default/news-classifier-server/api/v0.1/predictions
```

        "tags": {
        },
        "routing": {
        },
        "requestPath": {
          "news-classifier-server-processor": "axsauze/sklearn-server:0.1"
        },
        "metrics": []
      },
      "data": {
        "names": [],
        "ndarray": [2.0]
      }
    }

```python
!helm delete charts/sklearn-model-server
```

    seldondeployment.machinelearning.seldon.io "news-classifier-server" deleted


# Setting up CI before CD

We have now separated our model development into two chunks: 

* The first one involves the creation of a model serve, and the second one involves the CI of the model server, and the second involves the deployment of models that create the model.


## Using the Jenkins X pipeline

In order to do this we will be able to first run some tests and the push to the docker repo.

For this we will be leveraging the Jenkins X file, we'll first start with a simple file that just runs the tests:


```python
%%writefile jenkins-x.yml
buildPack: none
pipelineConfig:
  pipelines:
    release:
      pipeline:
        agent:
          image: seldonio/core-builder:0.4
        stages:
          - name: test-sklearn-server
            steps:
            - name: run-tests
              command: make
              args:
              - install_dev
              - test
    pullRequest:
      pipeline:
        agent:
          image: seldonio/core-builder:0.4
        stages:
          - name: test-sklearn-server
            steps:
            - name: run-tests
              command: make
              args:
              - install_dev
              - test
```

    Overwriting jenkins-x.yml


The `jenkins-x.yml` file is pretty easy to understand if we read through the different steps.

Basically we can define the steps of what happens upon `release` - i.e. when a PR / Commit is added to master - and what happens upon `pullRequest` - whenever someone opens a pull request.

You can see that the steps are exactly the same for both release and PR for now - namely, we run `make install_dev test` which basically installs all the dependencies and runs all the tests.

### Setting up the repo with the pipeline

In order for the Pipeline to be executed on PR and release, we must import it into our Jenkins X cluster. 

We can do this by running this command:


```python
!jx import --no-draft=true
```

As soon as we import the repository into Jenkins X, the release path gets triggered.

We can see the activities that have been triggered by running:


```python
!jx get activities
```


```python
And we can actually see the logs of what is happening at every step by running:
```


```python
!jx get build logs "$GIT_USERNAME/seldon-jx-mlops/master #1 release"
```


```python
As we can see, the `release` trigger is working as expected. We can now trigger the PR by opening a PR.

For this, let's add a small change and push a PR:
```


```bash
%%bash 

# Create new branch and move into it
git checkout -b feature-1

# Add an extra space at the end
echo " " >> jenkins-x.yml
git add jenkins-x
git commit -m "Added extra space to trigger master"
git push origin feature-1

# Now create pull request
git request-pull -p origin/master ./
```


```python
Once we create the pull request we can visualise that the PR has been created and the bot has commented.

We would now also be able to see that the tests are now running, and similar to above we can see the logs with:
```


```python
!kubectl get build logs "$GIT_USERNAME/seldon-jx-mlops/pr-1 #1 pr-build"
```

### Pushing images automatically
Now that we're able to build some tests, we want to update the images so we can have the latest on each release.

For this, we will have to add a couple of things, including:

1. The task in the `jenkins-x.yml` file that would allow us to build and push the image
2. Adding an authentication token so we can push images
3. Mounting the docker config in the `jenkins-x.yml` to provide docker authentications (to push images)
4. A script that starts a docker daemon and then builds+psuhes the images

#### JX Task to Build and Push image

For this, we would just have to append the following task in our jenkins file:
    
```
    - name: build-and-push-images
      command: bash
      args:
      - assets/scripts/build_and_push_docker_daemon.sh
```

#### Add docker auth to your cluster

Adding a docker authentication with Jenkins X can be done through a JX CLI command, which is the following:

* `jx create docker auth --host https://index.docker.io/v1/ --user $YOUR_DOCKER_USERNAME --secret $YOUR_DOCKER_KEY_SECRET --email $YOUR_DOCKER_EMAIL`

This comamnd will use these credentials to authenticate with Docker and create an auth token (which expires).

#### Config to provide docker authentication

This piece is slightly more extensive, as we will need to use Docker to build out containers due to the dependency on `s2i` to build the model wrappers.

First we need to define the volumes that we'll be mounting to the container.

The first few volumes before basically consist of the core components that docker will need to be able to run.
```
          volumes:
            - name: modules
              hostPath:
                path: /lib/modules
                type: Directory
            - name: cgroup
              hostPath:
                path: /sys/fs/cgroup
                type: Directory
            - name: dind-storage
              emptyDir: {}
```
We also want to mount the docker credentials which we will generate in the next step.
```
            - name: jenkins-docker-config-volume
              secret:
                items:
                - key: config.json
                  path: config.json
                secretName: jenkins-docker-cfg
```
Once we've created the volumes, now we just need to mount them. This can be done as follows:
```
        options:
          containerOptions:
            volumeMounts:
              - mountPath: /lib/modules
                name: modules
                readOnly: true
              - mountPath: /sys/fs/cgroup
                name: cgroup
              - name: dind-storage
                mountPath: /var/lib/docker                 
```
And finally we also mount the docker auth configuration so we don't have to run `docker login`:
```
              - mountPath: /builder/home/.docker
                name: jenkins-docker-config-volume
```

And to finalise, we need to make sure that the pod can run with privileged context.

The reason why this is required is in order to be able to run the docker daemon:
```
            securityContext:
              privileged: true
```

### Updating Jenkins X file and testing

# Integration tests

Now that we have a model that we want to be able to deploy, we want to make sure that we run end-to-end tests on that model to make sure everything works as expected.

For this we will leverage the same framework that the Kubernetes team uses to test Kubernetes itself: KIND.

KIND stands for Kubernetes in Docker, and is used to isolate a Kubernetes environent for end-to-end tests.

In our case, we will be able to leverage to create an isolated environment, where we'll be able to test our model.

For this, the steps we'll have to carry out include:

1. Leverage the `kind_run_all.sh` script that creates a KIND cluster and runs the tests
2. A simple test that performs integration testing on our model
3. The steps in the `Jenkins-X.yml` to run this in the production cluster

### Kind run all script

The kind_run_all may seem complicated at first, but it's actually quite simple. 

All the script does is set-up a kind cluster with all dependencies, deploy the model and clean everything up.

Let's break down each of the components within the script.

#### Start docker

We first start the docker daemon and wait until Docker is running (using `docker ps q` for guidance.

```
# FIRST WE START THE DOCKER DAEMON
service docker start
# the service can be started but the docker socket not ready, wait for ready
WAIT_N=0
while true; do
    # docker ps -q should only work if the daemon is ready
    docker ps -q > /dev/null 2>&1 && break
    if [[ ${WAIT_N} -lt 5 ]]; then
        WAIT_N=$((WAIT_N+1))
        echo "[SETUP] Waiting for Docker to be ready, sleeping for ${WAIT_N} seconds ..."
        sleep ${WAIT_N}
    else
        echo "[SETUP] Reached maximum attempts, not waiting any longer ..."
        break
    fi
done
```

#### Create and set-up KIND cluster

Once we're running a docker daemon, we can run the command to create our KIND cluster, and install all the components.

This will set up a Kubnernetes cluster using the docker daemon (using containers as Nodes), and then install Ambassador + Seldon Core.

```
#######################################
# AVOID EXIT ON ERROR FOR FOLLOWING CMDS
set +o errexit

# START CLUSTER 
make kind_create_cluster
KIND_EXIT_VALUE=$?

# Ensure we reach the kubeconfig path
export KUBECONFIG=$(kind get kubeconfig-path)

# ONLY RUN THE FOLLOWING IF SUCCESS
if [[ ${KIND_EXIT_VALUE} -eq 0 ]]; then
    # KIND CLUSTER SETUP
    make kind_setup
    SETUP_EXIT_VALUE=$?
```

#### Run python tests

We can now run the tests; for this we run all the dev installations and kick off our tests (which we'll add inside of the integration folder).

```
    # BUILD S2I BASE IMAGES
    make build
    S2I_EXIT_VALUE=$?

    ## INSTALL ALL REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES
    make install_integration_dev
    INSTALL_EXIT_VALUE=$?
    
    ## RUNNING TESTS AND CAPTURING ERROR
    make test
    TEST_EXIT_VALUE=$?
fi
```

#### Clean up

Finally we just clean everything, including the cluster, the containers and the docker daemon.

```
# DELETE KIND CLUSTER
make kind_delete_cluster
DELETE_EXIT_VALUE=$?

#######################################
# EXIT STOPS COMMANDS FROM HERE ONWARDS
set -o errexit

# CLEANING DOCKER
docker ps -aq | xargs -r docker rm -f || true
service docker stop || true
```



### Write an integration test

Now that we have the script that can kick everything off, we need too write a test that would run.

For this initial test, we'll write something very simple - it will be the exact test we had previously, but instead of running it by just calling the Python function, we will be sending a POST request using the Python SeldonClient.


```python
%%writefile integration/test_e2e_sklearn_server.py
from seldon_core.seldon_client import SeldonClient
import numpy as np

API_AMBASSADOR = "localhost:8003"

def test_sklearn_server():

    sc = SeldonClient(
        gateway="ambassador",

### Extend JenkinsX file for integration

Now that we have the test that would run for the integration tests, we need to extend the JX pipeline to run this.

This extension is quite simple, and only requires adding the following line:
    
```
            - name: run-end-to-end-tests
              command: bash
              args:
              - integration/kind_test_all.sh
```

This line would be added in both the PR and release pipelines so that we can run integration tests then.

It is also possible to move the integration tests into a separate jenkins-x file such as `jenkins-x-integration.yml` by leveraging [Contexts & Schedules]() which basically allow us to extend the functionality of Prow by writing our own triggers, however this is outside the scope of this tutorial.


```python

```
